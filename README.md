# What is this?
This is a list of Unicorn Open Source projects (according to my definition, super-awesome open source projects that have had a huge impact in their respective industries and are still actively maintained).

# Why?
You have, most probably, benefited from these projects, directly or indirectly. If you have some time to spare, consider giving back to these folks.
