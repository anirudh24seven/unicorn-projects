# What is this?
This is a list of Unicorn Open Source projects (according to my definition, super-awesome open source projects that have had a huge impact in their respective industries and are still actively maintained).

Note: This list is based on the opinions & perspectives of a wide audience-base of one: me. I am still yet to get familiar with many open source projects and I might have missed a few. I am sorry if your favorite project isn't included. Send me a pull request anyway.

# Why?
You have most probably benefited from these projects, directly or indirectly. If you have some time to spare, consider giving back to these folks.
